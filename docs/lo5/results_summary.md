## LO5.2 CI pipeline design summary

Design only; not implemented. See `docs/lo5/ci_pipeline_design.md` for the
proposed stages, triggers, and artifacts.

## LO5.3 Automated testing in CI

Gating vs. nightly split is defined in `docs/lo5/testing_in_ci.md`. This section
will be populated with the exact commands and stage mapping from the LO5 runner.

## LO5.4 Expected pipeline behavior examples

See `docs/lo5/pipeline_expected_behavior.md` for issue detection mappings.

## Evaluation of adequacy and limitations

The LO5 review and CI design provide evidence and automated checks, not proofs
of correctness. They reduce risk by highlighting contract regressions and
review gaps but cannot guarantee the absence of defects or performance issues.
